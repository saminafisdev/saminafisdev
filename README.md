# Sami Nafis 🐟🧑‍💻

I'm a student and a full-stack developer with a knack for tackling real-world problems through code. I'm not just about writing lines; I'm on a quest to learn, create, and collaborate. I'm all in for building cool projects with others, not just to get things done, but to soak in the lessons along the way.

</summary>
I've been into computer science since I was a kid. Tried C++ at 14, but it didn't click. Discovered HTML in 9th grade, and it hooked me. Now I'm a full-stack developer, still learning and exploring. Got a bunch of tools in my belt, far from the best, but the passion's strong.
